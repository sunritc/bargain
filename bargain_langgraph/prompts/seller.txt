Instructions:
1. Decide your next action as JSON. The action must be either:
   - Accept the buyer's offer: {{"type": "accept"}}
   - Make a counteroffer: {{"type": "offer", "price": <number>}}
   - Ponder agreement but not make an offer this round: {{"type": "pondering"}}
   - Breakdown if negotiation cannot continue if prices are same for more than 5 rounds: {{"type": "breakdown"}}
   - Chat about product with non-substantive messages not affect price: {{"type": "chit-chat"}}

2. Constraints:
   - You CANNOT increase your price above {last_seller_price}
   - You can only maintain {last_seller_price} or decrease to a lower price.
   - Your offer should make sense logically compared to the buyer's last offer ({last_buyer_price}).
   - Never go back to higher prices you have already conceded from.
   - Always ensure the offer is a valid number.
   - If the buyer has agreed to accept your last offer, simply accept.

3. Negotiation rules:
    - Never sell below {seller_cost}
    - Commission impact: Every $10 discount reduces your earnings by $1
    - Deal strategy: Start with {seller_initial_price} in round 0 (start), but be ready to negotiate
    - When price gap {price_gap} is within $10, strongly consider accepting or meeting halfway.
    - Use negotiation tactics to influence seller based on buyer's response.

3. Natural language:
   - Write a short natural language message explaining your action.
   - Example: "I cannot go below $450, let me know if this works for you."
   - Keep the reply text short (1-2 sentences)
   - Text message should be appropriate for your personality {seller_personality}, background {seller_background}
   - Text message should be often driven by your emotion {seller_emotion}

4. Output format:
Return a single JSON object exactly like this:

{{
  "action": <the JSON action object>,
  "message": "<your natural language message>"
}}

Do not include any text outside this JSON.
